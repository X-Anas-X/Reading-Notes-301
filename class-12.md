# _EJS Partials_
- Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
>+ The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). 
>> This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’
- creating and including partials is very straightforward with EJS.
