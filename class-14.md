# _Database Normalization:_
- Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.
*  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included.
+ By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database, This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.
- There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using.  As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic.

>-  Duplicated information presents two problems:
>> ncreases storage and decrease performance.
>>> It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
- You can eliminate or reduce anomalies by separating the data into different tables.
